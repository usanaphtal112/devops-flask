# Flask Transaction API with Jenkins CI/CD

This project is a simple Flask-based REST API that simulates credit card transactions. It includes basic validation logic and is integrated with a Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD. It's part of my journey to learn DevOps concepts, including continuous integration and delivery.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Flask** â€“ Python micro web framework used to build the API.
